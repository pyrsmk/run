> Run your tasks like a gangsta! ([DDU-DU DDU-DU!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHNzOHi8sJs))

This project is a proof-of-concept aiming to write concise and powerful tasks.

## Notes about Ruby vs Make

Many of you will probably think "What ?! I need to install a new language on my system to use Run ? And I also need yo learn Ruby ?!". To them, I would respond "Hey ! With make it's actually the same, but 100x worse !".

## Why ?

Across the years I've used several solutions to write my project tasks: Grunt, Gulp, Just (from Microsoft), make, Just (the Go project), ... There are plenty of solutions out there but they always come with flaws (in my opinion): too much verbosity, lack of performance, limited flexibility, etc.

Last years, I primarily used Makefiles since `make` is available for all environments and the base syntax is simple. But when you need to something more complex it's a real pain to handle. I could manage to achieve what I wanted for a couple of years but I finally reached a no-no point: the impossibility to simply handle functions with return values. Variables and functions in Makefiles are, in fact, expanded and resolved only once. Then, if you want to re-resolve something you cannot use that variable/function again and must copy/paste its behavior inside your task, making your Makefile more and more poorly factorized.

I'd already thought about some solutions a few years ago but they would have taken me too much time to write. Also, I was in a project with an extremely tight deadline. I wanted to have a way to express tasks with a concise syntax and yet the ability to write more advanced things clearly (like reading, writing a file, capture output of a command, ...) and displays an help screen natively. I wanted to use directly a language instead of writing a global framework with a special file syntax, because it would be way quicker to implement. Hence, this is why I chose Ruby.

Ruby have a comprehensive and exhaustive API, with a very concise syntax and good meta-programming features. A few hours later and all my tasks were running smoothly ðŸŽ‰

## Install

Install Ruby with the package manager of your environment, or download it from [the official page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

When you're done, download the source file to a directory in your PATH, for example:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrsmk/run/master/src/run -O ~/.local/bin/run
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/run
```

## Use

```sh
run your_task
```

If you want to display the available tasks:

```sh
run help
```

## Writing tasks

Now, you need to write your `Runfile.rb` in your project. Here's a simple example:

```rb
task :hello, "Displays hello" do
  puts "hello!"
end
```

`task` takes 3 arguments: the task name (as a symbol), the help string (which can be omitted) and a block which is the task to run. Here, the task is only displaying `hello` to the user (with [puts](https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/10/puts-vs-print/)).

> Be careful, a block is written with `do...end`.

### Shell commands

"But hey! How can we run arbitrary shell commands? Because this is what I'm here for at first..."

I hear you my dude. Here it is.

```rb
task :boom, "Destroys everything" do
  `echo 'boom!'`
  # Just kidding. Don't do this!
  `rm -rf /*`
end
```

```sh
# Contrary to what's expected, the `boom` task won't display `boom!`.
$ run boom
```

In Ruby you can run commands with backticks but note you won't have any output displayed on screen. Also, if the command fails the other tasks will continue to run. If you need something more fancy, you can use the `shell` function:

```rb
task :hello, "Displays hello" do
  shell "echo 'hello!'"
end
```

```sh
# It outputs the result of our task's commands.
$ run hello

> echo 'hello!'

hello!
```

Let's try with a failing command:

```rb
task :boom, "Access to an unknown file" do
  shell "stat foo"
  shell "echo 'hello!'"
end
```

It outputs:

```sh
$ run boom

> stat foo

stat: cannot stat 'foo': No such file or directory
```

### Functions and interpolation

Interpolation and the use of functions makes it trivial to integrate data inside your tasks. In Ruby, interpolation is as easy and powerful as you can do in JavaScript ([read about template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)).

```rb
def uid
  `id -u`.chomp
end

def gid
  `id -g`.chomp
end

task :fix_rights, "Fix user rights" do
  `sudo chown #{uid}:#{gid}`
end
```

> In Ruby, you can forgot about parens when you're calling a function.

> Note the `chomp` call after commands. These commands return STDOUT as a string with a trailing newline: `chomp` is used to trim them.

### Calling other tasks

One another useful feature is to being able to run tasks arbitrarily from other tasks:

```rb
task :eslint do
  shell "npx eslint"
end

task :flow do
  shell "npx flow"
end

task :lint_js do
  call :eslint
  call :flow
end
```

### Last word

You don't even have to learn Ruby to being able to use `run`. Just follow the documentation, and find what you need when you need it, if there're no available shell commands for that (save or load a file, generate a UUID, making complex requests, matching with a regex, ...).

Have fun!
